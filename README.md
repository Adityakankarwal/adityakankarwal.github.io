üëã Hi, I'm Aditya!

I'm a Python developer and DevOps Engineer with a whopping 2 years of experience. I'm currently working as an SRE at Deqode in Indore, where I'm working on the Modern Data Stack project. I'm also a proud graduate of SIRT Indore, where I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science Engineering.

üíº Experience

SRE - Deqode, Indore (Jun 2022 - Oct 2022)
Architected workflow to get data into Bigquery. Implemented ETL tool Airbyte and created its custom connector in python.
Implemented Apache Airflow as an orchestration tool to drive the whole workflow from spin up and SSH over instance to trigger reverse ETL script with Python DAG.
Implemented DBT to transform the data on BigQuery which was driven by Airflow over instance with SSH Operator.
Deployed all subprojects of MDS with Terraform and Gitlab CI over Google Kubernetes Engine.
Implemented custom IAP ,and Ingress using Terraform over GCP GKE.
Used GCP Data Catalog to find data in Datalake
Greendeck Product (Nov 2020 - May 2022)
Created a scrapper for getting data from 100+ websites using the Scrappy Library.
Used different methods to scrape data by network call and by using proxies(rotating proxies, residential proxies) and breached cloud flare by using Cloud scrapper.
Used Redis Queue to temporarily store and fetch the data for fast IO.
Mongofied the Redis data and inserted it in MongoDB using PyMongo.
Used ML scripts to classify the data.
Worked with Elastic Search using Python and by CLI to Transform, Insert and Query the data.
Worked on Airflow to schedule the scripts and used Celery to read queues and perform operations.
Worked with Docker and Kubernetes for containerizing the system.

üëÄ Wow, that's quite a bit of experience for a humble 2-year Python developer! But hey, who's counting, right?

ü§ñ I'm quite proud of my work on the Modern Data Stack project at Deqode. I mean, I architected the workflow to get data into Bigquery, implemented Apache Airflow, and deployed everything with Terraform and Gitlab CI over Google Kubernetes Engine. NBD.

üï∑Ô∏è And don't even get me started on my work with Greendeck Product. I created a scrapper to get data from over 100 websites, used ML scripts to classify the data, and containerized everything with Docker and Kubernetes. No big deal, just another day in the life of a Python developer.

üéì But hey, I'm always learning and looking to give back to mankind. Who knows what exciting projects the future holds?
